# 📊 DataTable to Image WebApp (or Weekly Table Creator as I call it.)

A simple web application that lets you **input data in a table** and **download it as a shareable image**. Perfect for my little use-case of having not to do this myself, so I made it easy for my non-tech-savvy aunt to use.

## ⚡ Features

- Interactive **data table** for entering information.
- Convert the table into a **PNG image**.
- **Download** the generated image with a single click.
- Works in the browser, no backend required. (might change. I have stuff I would like to add)
- Fully **customizable styling** for colors, fonts, and table layout. (Soon...)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Tanstack Start for React.js** – Frontend framework
- **html-to-image** – Converts HTML elements to PNG images
- Optional: **Shadcn UI / Tailwind CSS** for styling tables and buttons
